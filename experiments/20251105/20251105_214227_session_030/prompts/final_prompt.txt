. LLM-based agents realize their planning capabilities from the LLM. Furthermore, LLMs display significant potential in intent understanding and other aspects.  LLM-based agents may fail to reach correct knowledge by prompts, or even face the hallucination problem. Specialized tools enable LLMs to boost their expertise and adapt domain knowledge. The decision-making

LLMs do not, however, know what APIs are available, nor how to use them, nor how to interpret the information they return unless they are coded into the system. For example, suppose you are traveling, your flight connects through the world’s busiest airport, Hartsfield Atlanta Airport, and you want to know the weather at the airport because of a coming storm. The LLM will receive two prompts: your question about the weather is the user prompt, to which is added a secret additional piece of text called the system prompt.141 The system prompt is hidden from the user but vital for the end result

. Its functionality was entirely contained without any way to communicate with other systems except to return a text response. Once an LLM can go outside its system and call an API, the LLM is “agentic,” that is it is able to interact with the world beyond being limited to the system’s data and the user interaction at some level. In the parlance of the AI research community, the LLM is referred to as using “tools”, and the “tool” is another system that does some work on behalf of the LLM and is accessed via an API. Knowledge of these tools, however, doesn’t necessarily come from the LLM’s trai...

and trillion, respectively. While most LLMs are multilingual, their primary focus is often the English language.
”en-Wiki” denotes an English Wikipedia dump. This work focuses on general-purpose LLMs; for a domain-specific
survey on LLMs, multiple domains can be referred to in [68].

.  It is regarded that LLMs are equipped with human-like intelligence and common sense to preserve the potential to make us closer to the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) field. The emergence of LLMs is possibly the milestone of knowledge-driven agents, which perceive the environment and accumulate knowledge [17-27].  3 AI Agents  AI agents are capable to comprehend, predict, and response based on its training and input data. While these capabilities are developed and improved, it’s important to understand their limitations and the effect of the underlying data they are trained on. There ...
