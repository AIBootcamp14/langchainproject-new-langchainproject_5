**질문**: Transformer 관련 논문 통계를 SQL로 조회하고 결과 저장해줘

**생성된 SQL**:
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS paper_count, AVG(citation_count) AS avg_citations FROM papers WHERE abstract ILIKE '%transformer%' OR title ILIKE '%transformer%' GROUP BY category ORDER BY paper_count DESC LIMIT 100;
```
**결과**:

category | paper_count | avg_citations
--- | --- | ---
 | 25 | 0E-20
cs.CL | 2 | 25000.000000000000
